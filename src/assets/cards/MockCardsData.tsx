    description:'This year, Medium’s biggest resolution was to try to build a better internet. That’s a huge goal. It’s daring. It’s lofty. And, like every other goal, it would have fizzled into nothingness without being backed up by people willing to show up and do the work. I’m not only talking about Medium employees (although the 70-odd of us were dedicated and committed to that!). It’s the writers who share their best work with us. It’s the readers who leave thoughtful responses, no matter if they agree or disagree with the writer. It’s the publication editors who write the clearest, cleanest guidelines to help readers and writers know what to expect from their community. It’s the Medium power users who send us detailed feedback on what we can do better.',

    description:('We — employees, readers, writers, editors — put in the work, consistently, to try to build a better internet. It’s a big goal, but we’re tackling it one ladder rung at a time, together. In this post, you’ll get a few different looks into what happened on Medium in 2024 that help illustrate how we all showed up to help build a better internet. First, we’ll have a look at the numbers — what stories were the most popular, how many responses you left, and other quantitative metrics. But numbers can’t tell the whole story, so we’ll also dive into a more vibes-based look. You’ll find a collection of notable stories as well as some great new publications that found their home on Medium. Finally, we’ll include a few Medium-specific updates, like features we launched and milestones we achieved.'),
